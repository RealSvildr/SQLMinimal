# SQLMinimal

This library was made based on System.Data.Entity, but with the objective to be smaller and faster.

It uses Entity Framework 2.5

P.S.: If you don't want to use those Extensions methods, you can remove the file, but you have to paste the class Object into the DBContext file and change it to private.

TODO: 
  * Create it's own method of Commit, Save and Rollback
  * Create Personalized Exceptions
