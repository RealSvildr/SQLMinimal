# SQLMinimal

This library was made based at the System.Data.Entity, but with the objective to be smaller and faster.

It used the Entity Framework 2.5

P.S.: If you don't want to use those Extensions methods, you can remove it, but you have to paste the class Object into the DBContext file and change it to private.

TODO: 
  * Create it's own method of Commit, Save and Rollback
