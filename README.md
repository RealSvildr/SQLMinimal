# SQLMinimal v 1.2

This library was made based on System.Data.Entity, but with the objective to be smaller and faster.

Change Notes:

 â€¢ v1.2 - Included FileStream function to use with video streaming or data streaming


It uses Entity Framework 2.5

P.S.: If you don't want to use those Extensions methods, you can remove the file, but you have to paste the class Object into the DBContext file and change it to private.

  * Create it's own method of Commit, Save and Rollback
